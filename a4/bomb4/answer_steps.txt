for all:
run "gdb bomb"
break explode_bomb


6 arguments:
rdi
rsi
rdx
rcx
r8
r9

return rax

1)
print out the item that's being pushed into rsi before going into the string_not_equal
rdi is the input from the main
rsi is the item that is being compared
if you print the rsi, you get the answer

2)
so, get first six numbers will take the array of the first six numbers of the input.
for my bomb, they compare first 2 numbers (0 and 1) before entering a loop
basically i have to find input that would eventually allow me to reach the same address as the 5th number.
