Binomial trial 
1) A trail with two outcomes usually called "success" and "failure"
2) There is a fixed probability of "success" = p (1-p for failure)
3) When we have many trails together, the probability of "success" in each trail does not change
4) When we have N trails the probability of k successes is given by the binomial distribution bin(N,k,p)
	-N = number of tries
	-k = number of successes
	-p = prob of success
